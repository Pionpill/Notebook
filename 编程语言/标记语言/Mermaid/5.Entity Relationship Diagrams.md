<h2> bisic introduction </h2><hr>

<h3> function </h3>

- An entity–relationship model (or ER model) describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain of knowledge    <span class=speaker>——Wikipedia </span>

<h3> example </h3>

<div class=mermaid align="center">
    erDiagram
        CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
        ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
        CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
</div>

<h2> Syntax </h2><hr>
<h3> Entities and Relationships </h3>

- grammer:
  ```
  <first-entity> <relationship> <second-entity> : <relationship-label>
  ```
- first-entity: the name of an entity
  - Names must begin with an alphabetic character and may also contain digits and hyphens
- relationship: the way that both entities inter-relate
- second-entity: the name of the other entity
- relationship-label: the relationship from the perspective of the first entity.

<h3> Relationship Syntax</h3>

- The relationship part of each statement can be broken down into three sub-components
  - the cardinality of the first entity with respect to the second
    - Cardinality is a property that describes how many elements of another entity can be related to the entity in question
  - whether the relationship confers identity on a ‘child' entity
  - the cardinality of the second entity with respect to the first
- Cardinality list
  | Value(left) | Value(right) | Meaning                       |
  | :---------: | :----------: | ----------------------------- |
  |    \\\|o    |    o\\\|     | Zero or one                   |
  |  \\\|\\\|   |   \\\|\\\|   | Exactly one                   |
  |     }o      |      o{      | Zero or more (no upper limit) |
  |    }\\\|    |    \\\|{     | One or more (no upper limit)  |
  |             |              |                               |

<h3> Identification </h3>

- Relationships may be classified as either identifying or non-identifying and these are rendered with either solid or dashed lines respectively. This is relevant when one of the entities in question can not have independent existence without the other
- example
  
<div class=mermaid align="center">
    erDiagram
        CAR ||..o{ NAMED-DRIVER : allows
        PERSON ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : is
</div>

<h3> Other Things </h3>

- use double quotes around the phrase to make more than one word
- use an empty double-quoted string to make a label empty
